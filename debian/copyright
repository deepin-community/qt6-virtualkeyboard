#Comment:
# The following files are binary blobs and mostly not in the preferred form
# of modification, so we cannot ship them:
# .
#  - tcime/data/java/*.dat
#  - tcime/data/qt/*.dat
#  - openwnn/wnnEngine/predef_table.h
#  - openwnn/wnnEngine/WnnJpnDic.c
#  - pinyin/data/dict_pinyin.dat
# .
# If someone needs this functionality in Qt Virtual Keyboard, we recommend
# them to package the modules in question so we can use them as system
# libraries.
